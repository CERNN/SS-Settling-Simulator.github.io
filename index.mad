The Research Center for Rheology and Non-Newtonian Fluids (CERNN) was created by faculty members of the Mechanical Engineering Courses (undergraduate and graduate levels) of the Federal University of Technology-Paran√° (UTFPR). 

CERNN works aim at researching in the areas of Flow, Heat Transfer and Rheology of Non-Newtonian Fluids, either in continuum or in porous-continuum media. The conducted researches find application in several areas, such as Food, Petroleum and Cosmetic Industry, etc.
